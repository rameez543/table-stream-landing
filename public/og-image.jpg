I need to save the image you provided. However, I cannot directly save the image from your message. Could you please save the image file as `/Users/rameez/Desktop/table-stream-landing/public/og-image.jpg` manually, or provide the image file in a format I can process?

Once you've saved the image, the metadata is already correctly configured to reference it at:
- `https://tablestream.io/og-image.jpg` for Open Graph
- `https://tablestream.io/og-image.jpg` for Twitter cards

The image should be:
- Exactly 1200x630 pixels for optimal social media display
- Named `og-image.jpg`
- Placed in the `/public/` directory
